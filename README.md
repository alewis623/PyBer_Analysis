# Overview of Pyber Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to study Pyber's ride-sharing data by city type of Urban, Suburban and Rural. The analysis is to summarize how the data differs by each city type. this analysis will be shared with leadership at Pyber. There is both charts and a graph as part of this analysis. The files city_data.csv and ride_data.csv were combined for the analysis. Citys were grouped by type to analysize at a macro level the differences of type of city had on the data. 
## Resources
  * Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv. Both files are saved in the Resources section of the GitHub repository.
  * Software: Juypter Notebook 6.3.0, Python Virtual environment 3.7.10 named PythonData. Matplotlib and Pandas libraries were also used in this analysis. 
## Results

Some of the key findings from this analysis are seen in the chart below:

* Urban cities:
    Urban cities have the most rides at 1,625. The most drivers at 2,405 and the highest total fares of $39,854.38. Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride of $24.53 and average fare per driver of $16.57.
   
* Suburban cities:
     Suburban cities have 625 rides. They have 490 drivers. The fares are inbetween the Urban and Rural results at $19,356.33. The average fare per ride is $30.97. The average fare per driver is $39.50.
     
* Rural cities:
      Rural cities have the fewest riders with 125. The fewest drivers 78, and the lowest total fares at $4,327.93. The Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride of $34.62 and the highest average fare per driver of $55.49

When you take the first 4 months of 2019 as a graph the comparison of city type. There is more fare dollars in Urban and Suburban cities over Rural.

There is is more variablity during the end of February and the beginning of April this fluctuation is more noticable in the Urban markets.

## Summary
Recomendations would be to further investigate the fluctuations that occured for Urban cities and to a lessor extent Suburban and Rural markets. Additional analysis could be reviewed for profitablity of the Rural markets. To determine if higher averages translates to higher profit in those areas.
